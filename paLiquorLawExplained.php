				<h1><center>The Odd Liquor Laws of PA</center></h1>
					<p>
						Throwing a party? In the great state of Pennsylvania, you may have to go to three different stores just to get the booze.
						Want a case of beer? You need to go to a beer distributor. Need a bootle of somthing stronger? Then you have to go to a 
						state run liquor store. Do you just need a single six pack for that guest with the exquisite taste? Well, you will have 
						to go to yet another store for that.
					</p>
					
					<h2>Why all the confusion and running around? </h2>
						
					<p>	
						When prohibition ended in 1933, the power to regulate alcohol sales fell back into the hands of the state governments. Each state now 
						had the power to implement its own set of laws to govern the sale of alcohol. Some states developed strict laws that required heavy
						state oversite, and some were more lax on their regulation. Pennsylvania was one of the states that opted to create a set of harsh 
						laws to "protect" its peoples from the dangers of alcohol. The state's attempt create a "New World Order" for the benefit of humanity
						resulted in four new rules.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Only state run liquor stores are legally alound to sell hard alcohol that is to be consumed off premise.</li>
						<li>Only privately owned distributors may facilitate the distibution of large quantities of beer. i.e. cases and 
						kegs, but not six-packs or individual bottles.</li>
						<li>Enterprises that are not distributors may not sell alcohol unless they are a bar. i.e. Walmart and other 
						grocery stores may not sell alcohol.</li>
						<li>Privately owned bars may sell drinks to be consumed on premise and may sell small amounts of beer to go. 
						i.e. 6 or 12 packs only, no 30 racks</li>
					</ul>
					<p> Thanks to these new laws implemented by the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, we are now a safer and more productive society. Yea right,
					all these laws do is delay your party by making you shop at 3 or 4 different different stores. 
					Since these rules do not allow for the existance of a one stop party shop, we will try to clarify where you can find your beverages below.<p/>
					
					<h2>Liquor Stores</h2>
					<p><b>Go to a Liquor store if you want a bottle of wine, or hard alcohol</b></p>
					<p>Liquor stores go by the name "Fine Wine and Good Spirts" in PA. These stores are the only retailers that are aloud to sell
					liqour. Since the state has a monopoly on liquor sales, there is little varity between 
					liquor stores in Pennsylvania. They all have the same name, same products, and same prices. That means a bottle of Grey Goose 
					costs the same in center city Philadelphia and rural Lycoming County. State stores, as liquor stores are often called by local 
					Pennsylvania's, are also in charge of wine sales in PA. While local winerys can also sell their own product, there are few of these in 
					PA. So normally, you must also go to a liquor store to get a bottle of wine. These stores may not sell beer or other malt beverages.</p>
					
					<h2>Beer Distributors</h2>
					<p><b>Go to a beer distibutor if you want a keg or full case of beer </b></p>
					Beer Distributors are privately owned stores that may sell only large quantities of beer, malt beverages, and soda. Large quantities 
					historically refers to 24 packs and up. However, in 2015, the state began to allow distributors to also sell 12 packs. Distributors are the stores to
					go to for all your bulk-beer needs. They sell mostly 24 packs, 30 packs, and kegs. These stores are not alloud to sell small quantities
					 of beer such as 6 packs or individual bottles. You can not find wine or liqour at these locations.
					
					<h2>Bars and Bottle Shops</h2>
					<p><b>Go to a bar or bottle shop if you want a to buy individual bottles, six-packs, or twelve-packs or beer</b></p>
					If you only want a six pack of beer, then you must go to a bar. While there are a few stores that sell six packs, they are licensed
					as bars and therefore can not sell cases even though they may look like a distributor. Bars may sell liquor by the bottle, but it must be consumed on premise. 
					If you want to get beer to take home, you may not
					legally purchase more than 192 oz of beer per purchase. This means you can not buy 3 six packs at a time. While most stores will just make
					you swipe your credit card twice if you want to buy more than 192oz, many will make you walk out and re-enter the store.
