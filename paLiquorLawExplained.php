				<h1><center>The Odd Liquor Laws of PA</center></h1>
					<p>
						Throwing a party? In the great state of Pennsylvania, you may have to go to three different stores just to get the booze. Want a case of beer? You need to go to a beer distributor. Need a bootle of somthing stronger? Then you have to go to a state run liquor store. Do you just need a single six pack for that guest with the exquisite taste? Well, you will have to go to yet another store for that.
					</p>
					<p>
						Why all the confusion and running around? </p> </br>
						More coming soon
